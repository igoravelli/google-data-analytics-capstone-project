## The scenario
I work for a tourism company and was designated to find the best Airbnb hosting in Europe for one of our clients. To do that I have a sort of data about some Airbnb hosts in Europe to explore and complete this task.

Between their requirements are privacy, price, and location.
They are 4 people and anyone doesn't drive. So, the distance to a means of public transport is an important point.
